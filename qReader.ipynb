    "When teenagers get bored, they struggle to stay motivated and often lose sight of their goals. Boredom often results in apathy, so many teens neglect their school work, extracurricular activities and household chores when they feel lethargic and unmotivated. For some teens, boredom leads to trouble because they engage in unhealthy activities to boost their excitement level. Most teens feel frustrated when they experience long periods of boredom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bored teens often experience low energy levels that affect their school work, attitudes, goals and attention spans. Persistent boredom often leads to low energy levels, loss of concentration, lack of motivation and slow thinking skills, according to PsychCentral.com. A bored teenager might skip school or neglect family chores because he doesn't have the energy or motivation to accomplish tasks. Parents can help by ensuring that their teen makes it to school, completes his homework and fulfills his home responsibilities. Parents might need to use an alarm clock, activity chart or other time-management strategies to make sure their teen doesn't sleep all day.\n",
